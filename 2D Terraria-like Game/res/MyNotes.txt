All performance boosting techniques will raise frame-rate:
- view-frustum culling,
- occlusion culling,
- LOD,
- early-Z/pre-Z/fast-Z (rendering order),
- bindless (NV specific) or display lists,
- instancing,
- grouping by state,
- etc. 

world border rendering:
- on edge of the world, render the other side of the map outwards, eg. if x(chunk) = 29, render chunk 1 and 2 to right.
- when player crosses the border, teleport to other edge of the world. start rendering normally.

world gen. previewer:
- preview full map
- code can be used for similar (mini)map that exists in e.g. PUBG, Rust...

levels:
[0] = all except...
[1] = LEAF
