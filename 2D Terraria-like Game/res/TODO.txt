NEXT UP (plans):
-> lights
	-> different colors (torches like in terraria)
	-> bonfire, large light
-> map previewer (render whole map on screen, pause game)
	- previewer:
		-> optimize by generating a texture of the map and rendering it
		-> mouse callback
		-> move map by dragging, zoom infinitely with wheel
	- map:
		-> water deeper areas darker
TODO list:
- own function for continuous key input, one for text-like input
	-> everything else other than movement in text-like input ------------------------------ next?
- large auto generated map
	- random seed on every execution
	- later:
		- biomes: cellular noise / natural distance function
		- buildings with random generated loot
		- caves:
			- new world? i guess
- collision detection
- monsters/enemies
- text support
- health system
- inventory system
- items
- item functionality
- ammo system?
- ImGUI for FPS and testing
- Python scripted command line commands
